Introduction
============

Thanos Ipsum is a quote generator and API service that delivers the iconic lines of Marvel's Mad Titan, Thanos. 
There are many Ipsum generators out there but only one can generate the wisdom of Thanos.
Use the `web interface <https://thanos-ipsum.onrender.com>`__ to summon some quotes of doom from the 
intergalactic warlord or integrate the service into your own projects through the Thanos API, the baddest API on the internet. 

**Thanos Ipsum** is a side project that combines web development with API design. It offers:

- A web interface to generate and copy Thanos quotes.
- A dev-friendly API to fetch quotes from specific movies or in random batches.
- A lightweight and elegant frontend.
